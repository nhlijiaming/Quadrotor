# Quadrotor
This is an autonomous quadrotor. We utilized an optical flow sensor ADNS3080 to pin-point the exact location of the quadrotor indoor. And then with the PID controllers, the quadrotor can be stabilized and flight autonomously. It can move forward exactly a meter away.

With well-tuned parameters, its performance is quite outstanding.
